# iMprovedkancli

This is my improved version of the [Charmbracelet's Kanban CLI demo repository](https://github.com/charmbracelet/kancli).

My goal is to deepen my understanding of Charmbracelet tools by modifying and extending this project.

### What's New

- **feat(board): add status message for task movement** (`5e8f27b`)
- **feat(board): add status message for task deletion** (`606017a`)
- **feat(board): add status message for task creation** (`42adfad`)
